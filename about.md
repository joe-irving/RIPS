# Rebels in Prison Support

**Exists to support activists in prison in the UK.**

For necessary action on the climate emergency we need to see hundreds of individuals in prison before the year is out and RIPS Rebels in Prison Support exists to support activists wanting to take that next step of action.

RIPS is an independent organisation set up by individuals from Extinction Rebellion, Burning Pink & other independent groups.

Support we offer: sending packages of exercises & activities, forwarding (& paying for) emails from wellwishers around the world, keeping your story alive on the outside, financial support for commissary in prison, a support network from volunteers to keep everyone necessary in the loop

## Who do we support?

Although set up to support climate activists, RIPS will support any individual in prison for law-breaking pushing for political change. We will support any non-violent action defined by no intentional damage to a human or animal body.
