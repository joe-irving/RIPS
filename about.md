Rebels in Prison Support (RIPS) was set up by the family and friends of people held on remand in prison after climate protests in 2021. 

We have supported {{ site.rebels | size }} individuals in Prison since 2021 ranging from remand for days/weeks to sentences up to 3 years!

RIPS exists to support activists who have been imprisoned for non-violent/peaceful protest.

RIPS supports activists from a range of organisations including Just Stop Oil, Insulate Britain, Palestine Action, Extinction Rebellion, Animal Rising and more.

We are a volunteer core team coordinating a wider network of buddies and helpers. We work to ensure that all those taking non-violent action that may result in prison are prepared and supported both practically and emotionally.




## What we spend money on:

* Emails to send and reply via emailaprisoner.com
* Commissary money
* Sending people things in prison (printing & postage)
* Website and hosting
* Transport and Expenses
* Post Prison support – including gatherings and debriefs

## **Who do we support?**

Although set up to support climate activists, RIPS will support any individual in prison for law-breaking pushing for a better world. We will support any non-violent action defined by no intentional damage to a human or animal body.

## **Thanks to…**

When I first reached out for support, Gabriella Ditton immediately replied with all sorts of fantastic ideas of how else we could support future rebels, and has been a constant source of inspiration and motivation for which I’m eternally grateful.

To G.J for contributing all the lovely artwork and poems, and all your continued support and suggestions.

To The Prison Phoenix Trust for giving me access to all their wonderful work made especially for prisoners.

And to all the rebels and their supporters out there making the movement move.
