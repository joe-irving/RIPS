Rebels in Prison Support (RIPS) was set up by the family and friends of people held on remand in prison after climate protests in 2021. 

We have supported {{ site.rebels | size }} individuals in Prison since 2021 ranging from remand for days/weeks to sentences up to 3 years!

RIPS exists to support activists who have been imprisoned for non-violent/peaceful protest.

RIPS supports activists from a range of organisations including Just Stop Oil, Insulate Britain, Palestine Action, Extinction Rebellion, Animal Rising and more.

We are a volunteer core team coordinating a wider network of buddies and helpers. We work to ensure that all those taking non-violent action that may result in prison are prepared and supported both practically and emotionally.

## What we spend money on:

* Emails to send and reply via emailaprisoner.com
* Commissary money
* Sending people things in prison (printing & postage)
* Website and hosting
* Transport and Expenses
* Post Prison support – including gatherings and debriefs

## **Who do we support?**

Although initially set up to support climate activists, RIPS will support any individual in prison for non-violent\* protest.

\*Non-violence is defined as not causing harm to any human or animal. In the context of protest, non-violence is defined as using peaceful means rather than force to bring about change.
