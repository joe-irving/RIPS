# Donate

Please consider donating to the [Rebels in Prison Support fundraiser](https://chuffed.org/project/rips).

Please consider making a recurring monthly donation if you can. It will help us plan our activities effectively.

## How we spend the money:

* Communicating with people in prison via the Email a Prisoner service
* Commissary money
* Sending letters and packages to people in prison
* Our website
* Transport + Expenses
* In the future it would be nice to offer legal support
