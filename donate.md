# Donate

Donations can be made to the [Rebels in Prison Support crowdfunding campaign](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/rebelsinprisonsupport).

Please consider making a recurring monthly donation if you can. It will help us plan our activities effectively.

## How we spend the money:

* Communicating with people in prison via the Email a Prisoner service
* Commissary money
* Sending letters and packages to people in prison
* Our website
* Transport + Expenses
* In the future it would be nice to offer legal support
