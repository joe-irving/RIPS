# Rebels in Prison Website

## Editing pages

This site uses a Forestry.IO content management service.

1. Sign in at [/admin](https://rebelsinprison.uk/admin)
1. Navigate to the relevant tab in the menu and start editing

Here you can create, edit and add:

* Blog posts
* The [site configuration](https://github.com/joe-irving/RIPS/blob/master/_config.yml)
* The [resources list](https://rebelsinprison.uk/resources/)

Once you press **Save** the site takes about 3 minutes to rebuild,
so if you are getting inpatient then a cup of tea might be a good idea. If you really want to watch the progress of the site building head over to the
[GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/joe-irving/RIPS/actions) to watch the
orange loading blob.

## The Rebel Database

This website builds its [list of rebels](https://rebelsinprison.uk/rebels/all/)
from
[a public spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oNfGY6SG0PyZeOg6HLQ18Ul0MYNAR4mdRCrYTKKKhUs/preview)
that only admins can edit.

This is currently (3-May-21) being imported to the website every 15 minutes,
so it shouldn't take long for your edits to appear on the site.
