      # About


      For necessary action on the climate emergency, we need to take urgent,
      radical, direct action. As the government continues to fight us, more and
      more people will be held on remand - in prison - before they get a trial.
      Rebels in Prison Support exists to support activists wanting to take that
      next step of action.
