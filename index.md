      # About


      Rebels in Prison Support exists to support non-violent activists.


      The government continues to take steps to end our right to peaceful
      protest with increasingly draconian laws. This has led to more and more
      peaceful protesters being held on remand and sentenced to prison. The
      sentences are getting more severe.
