# Join us

Please email [rebelsinprison@gmail.com](mailto:rebelsinprison@gmail.com "rebelsinprison@gmail.com") if you have any time to give to support activists in
prison in the UK.

We would really appreciate any help with the following areas:

## Creative

Could you create content that could be sent to those in prison to help improve their time in prison?

This could be articles/puzzles/exercises or anything that can be sent by email or in the post (there are significant restrictions on what can be sent into prisons by post).

## Media

Could you post on our social media accounts, sharing stories, talking to other organisations, encouraging others to support RIPS?

## Wellbeing

Forwarding emails to prisoners via [emailaprisoner.com](https://emailaprisoner.com) and being in close communication with each prisoner’s support team.

Each support team includes;

* A point of contact (who have direct phone contact with prisoner – usually a friend or family member)
* A buddy -someone to forward emails to the prisoner through [emailaprisoner.com](https://emailaprisoner.com) and other support as needed.
* Other friends/supporters/family
* A member of RIPS core team

## Digital

Help maintain the website and other digital tools. Email [rebelsinprison@gmail.com](mailto:rebelsinprison@gmail.com "rebelsinprison@gmail.com") if you are interested.
