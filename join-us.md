Please contact us below if you have any time to give to support activists in
prison in the UK.

If you have any time at all to help, we would really appreciate any help with the following areas:

## Creative

Ideally, we would like to create a monthly zine to distribute
among prisoners with activist news, activities and other engaging things.

[Creative](#creative) and [Wellbeing](#wellbeing) will work together
on what gets sent to prisoners.

## Media

Social media accounts, sharing stories, talking to other organisations, communication, pointing volunteers in the right direction

## Wellbeing

Getting information and exercises to prisoners to improve their physical and emotional wellbeing. Forwarding emails to prisoners via [emailaprisoner.com](https://emailaprisoner.com) and being in close communication with each prisoner's remand support team. If they do not have a remand support team, we create one.

Ideally in each support team you want:

* Their point of contact 1 (who have direct phone contact with prisoner)
* Someone happy to forward emails to the prisoner through [emailaprisoner.com](https://emailaprisoner.com)
* Their solicitor / lawyer (although this might not be possible)
* A family member
* A couple of friends

## Digital

Help maintain the website and other digital tools. Email rebelsinprison@protonmail.com if you are interested.
