# Join us

Please email [rebelsinprison@gmail.com](mailto:rebelsinprison@gmail.com "rebelsinprison@gmail.com") if you have any time to give to support activists in
prison in the UK.

We would really appreciate any help with the following areas:

## Creative

Could you create content that could be sent to those in prison to help improve their time in prison?

This could be articles/puzzles/exercises or anything that can be sent by email or in the post (there are significant restrictions on what can be sent into prisons by post).

## Media

Could you post on our social media accounts, sharing stories, talking to other organisations, encouraging others to support RIPS?

## Wellbeing

Getting information and exercises to prisoners to improve their physical and emotional wellbeing. Forwarding emails to prisoners via [emailaprisoner.com](https://emailaprisoner.com) and being in close communication with each prisoner's remand support team. If they do not have a remand support team, we create one.

Ideally in each support team you want:

* Their point of contact 1 (who have direct phone contact with prisoner)
* Someone happy to forward emails to the prisoner through [emailaprisoner.com](https://emailaprisoner.com)
* Their solicitor / lawyer (although this might not be possible)
* A family member
* A couple of friends

## Digital

Help maintain the website and other digital tools. Email [rebelsinprison@gmail.com](mailto:rebelsinprison@gmail.com "rebelsinprison@gmail.com") if you are interested.
