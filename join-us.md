If you have any time at all to help, we would really appreciate
any help with the following areas:

## Creative

Ideally, we would like to create a monthly magazine to distribute
among prisoners with activist news, activities and other engaging things.

[Creative](#creative) and [Wellbeing](#wellbeing)

## Wellbeing

Getting information and exercises to prisoners to improve their physical and emotional wellbeing. Forwarding emails to prisoners via [emailaprisoner.com](https://emailaprisoner.com) and being in close communication with each prisoner's remand support team. If they do not have a remand support team, we create one.

Ideally in each support team you want:

* Their point of contact 1 (who have direct phone contact with prisoner)
* Someone happy to forward emails to the prisoner through [emailaprisoner.com](https://emailaprisoner.com)
* Their solicitor / lawyer (although this might not be possible)
* A family member
* A couple of friends
